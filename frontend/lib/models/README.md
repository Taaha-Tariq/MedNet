# Models

- `user_model.dart`: Authenticated user profile and token handling.
- `health_data_model.dart`: Health metric representation including `type`, `value`, `unit`, `timestamp`, and optional `additionalData` (e.g., diastolic for BP).

Usage: Models map directly to backend API payloads and responses.
